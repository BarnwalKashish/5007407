Exercise 4: Implementing the Adapter Pattern
Scenario: 
You are developing a payment processing system that needs to integrate with multiple third-party payment gateways with different interfaces. Use the Adapter Pattern to achieve this.
Steps:
1.Create a New Java Project:
oCreate a new Java project named AdapterPatternExample.
2.Define Target Interface:
oCreate an interface PaymentProcessor with methods like processPayment().
3.Implement Adaptee Classes:
oCreate classes for different payment gateways with their own methods.
4.Implement the Adapter Class:
oCreate an adapter class for each payment gateway that implements PaymentProcessor and translates the calls to the gateway-specific methods.
5.Test the Adapter Implementation:
oCreate a test class to demonstrate the use of different payment gateways through the adapter.

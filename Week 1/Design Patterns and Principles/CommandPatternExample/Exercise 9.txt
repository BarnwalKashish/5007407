Exercise 9: Implementing the Command Pattern
Scenario: You are developing a home automation system where commands can be issued to turn devices on or off. Use the Command Pattern to achieve this.
Steps:
1.Create a New Java Project:
oCreate a new Java project named CommandPatternExample.
2.Define Command Interface:
oCreate an interface Command with a method execute().
3.Implement Concrete Commands:
oCreate classes LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand that implement Command.
4.Implement Invoker Class:
oCreate a class RemoteControl that holds a reference to a Command and a method to execute the command.
5.Implement Receiver Class:
oCreate a class Light with methods to turn on and off.
6.Test the Command Implementation:
oCreate a test class to demonstrate issuing commands using the RemoteControl.

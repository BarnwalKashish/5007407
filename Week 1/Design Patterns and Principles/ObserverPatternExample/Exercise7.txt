Steps:
1.Create a New Java Project:

oCreate an interface Stock with methods to register, deregister, and notify observers.
3.Implement Concrete Subject:
oCreate a class StockMarket that implements Stock and maintains a list of observers.
4.Define Observer Interface:
oCreate an interface Observer with a method update().
5.Implement Concrete Observers:
oCreate classes MobileApp, WebApp that implement Observer.
6.Test the Observer Implementation:
oCreate a test class to demonstrate the registration and notification of observers.

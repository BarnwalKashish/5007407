Exercise 6: Implementing the Proxy Pattern
Scenario: 
You are developing an image viewer application that loads images from a remote server. Use the Proxy Pattern to add lazy initialization and caching.
Steps:
1.Create a New Java Project:
oCreate a new Java project named ProxyPatternExample.
2.Define Subject Interface:
oCreate an interface Image with a method display().
3.Implement Real Subject Class:
oCreate a class RealImage that implements Image and loads an image from a remote server.
4.Implement Proxy Class:
oCreate a class ProxyImage that implements Image and holds a reference to RealImage.
oImplement lazy initialization and caching in ProxyImage.
5.Test the Proxy Implementation:
oCreate a test class to demonstrate the use of ProxyImage to load and display images.

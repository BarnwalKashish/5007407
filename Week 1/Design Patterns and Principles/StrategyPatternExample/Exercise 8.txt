Exercise 8: Implementing the Strategy Pattern
Scenario: 
You are developing a payment system where different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) can be selected at runtime. Use the Strategy Pattern to achieve this.
Steps:
1.Create a New Java Project:
oCreate a new Java project named StrategyPatternExample.
2.Define Strategy Interface:
oCreate an interface PaymentStrategy with a method pay().
3.Implement Concrete Strategies:
oCreate classes CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment that implement PaymentStrategy.
4.Implement Context Class:
oCreate a class PaymentContext that holds a reference to PaymentStrategy and a method to execute the strategy.
5.Test the Strategy Implementation:
Create a test class to demonstrate selecting and using different payment strategies.
